Changelog for CPAN-Testers-API

{{ $NEXT }}

    [Added]

    - Added `render_error` helper to reduce boilerplate for error
      reporting.

    - Added `Rexfile` deploy script to deploy the app with
      [Rex](http://rexify.org).

    [Fixed]

    - Reduced the amount of release data transmitted. There were fields
      in the release summary API that aren't important or needed, so
      they were removed. Also, results for development Perl releases are
      no longer included in the API.

    - Disabled the `?since` parameter when querying all release summary
      data. This feature causes the database query to be too slow:
      Fetching all the data takes about a minute, fetching only the last
      day's worth of data takes hours before it times out.

    - Initial release. This module is a JSON API for CPAN Testers data
      using Mojolicious and CPAN::Testers::Schema.
